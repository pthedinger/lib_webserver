<h1>xSOFTip Website Component Example</h1>

<p>This is a demo of the embedded website software component. This
  component preprocesses website data and stores it in the program
  memory or on an attached serial flash. You can include text and images:</p>

<p><img src="images/xmos_logo.png" /></p>

<p>The file system of the web tree is reflected in the server:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="page.html">Another page</a></li>
<li><a href="dir1/page.html">A page in a sub-directory</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can also include dynamic content like this timestamp from an XC
  timer: {% get_timer_value(buf,1) %}
</p>

<p>
  The functions called during rendering can also include state. For
  example, here is a page load counter for this page: {% get_counter_value(app_state,buf) %}
</p>


<p>The server can also understand html form data. Try entering some
  text in the field below</p>

<form name="form" action = "form.html" method="post">
<input name='input' type='text'/>
<input type="submit" Value="Go!"/>
</form>

</body>
</html>
